# Mawaru

A terminal colorscheme inspired by the art of [Mawaru
Penguindrum](https://myanimelist.net/anime/10721/Mawaru_Penguindrum).

## Installation

Currently, this repository only has an Xresources file. Download the file, then
`#include` it in your `~/.Xresources`. This will configure any application that
uses `*color{0..15}` resource to use Mawaru.

## To-do

* Change cyan colors.
* Preview images.
* Configurations for other terminals emulators.
* Vim colorscheme.
